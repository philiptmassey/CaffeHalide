<h2>Title</h2>
<p>
Halide Implementation of the Caffe Deep Learning Framework - Philip Massey & Arjun Kar
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Our project is to port the deep learning framework <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a> to the image processing language <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a>.
However, this is a daunting project.
In the event that this proves too difficult / impractical with the current state of the framework or language, we may opt to instead do a simplier project.
Based on which of the two resources are proving difficult, we will either port Caffe to a Xeon Phi, or develop a neural network in Halide.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>
The project is challenging because of both the subejct matter and the project implementation.
Deep learning through neural networks is a nontrivial application of machine learning.
Simply developing the methods of forward and backward propagation to train the weights of hidden layers is a challenge. 
On top of this algorithm, this project requires a deep understanding of the Caffe deep learning framework and the Halide image processing language.
Caffe is known for being one of the best implementations of neural networks and is developed for both CPUs and GPUs.
Halide is a powerful API / language built on C++ used for image processing in an object-oriented method. 
Our primary goal, porting the backend of Caffe to Halide, will test our understanding of the two resources.
<br>
In the event that our primary goal is too difficult, we have two planned backup goals.
The first is in the event that understanding Caffe's source code to the point of being able to port it to a new langauge is too difficult.
In this event, we will instead implement a nueral network in Halide.
In the event that learning Halide proves too difficult or we reason that Halide's approach to development is impractical for a neural network, we will instead port Caffe to a Xeon Phi. 
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
For this project, we will utilize the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe Deep-Learning Framework</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide Programming Language</a> </li>
<li> Latedays Cluster (possibly) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals & Deliverables</h2>
<p>
By the end of this project, we hope to have a working implementation of Caffe's neural network written in Halide.
We will then compare (and perhaps optimize) the performance of this algorithm with other implementations.
In the event that this component of our project isn't completed and we simply port Caffe to a Xeon Phi or develop a neural network in Halide, we will compare performance via training time, testing time, and accuracy with other CPU and GPU implementations.
These tests would be done on a consistent dataset, such as CIFAR-10. 
</p>

<h2>Platform Choices</h2>
<p>
We will be working in unix environment, coding our project in C++ and Halide.
This is because Caffe is originally in C++, and Halide is our target port language.
If our project gains the objective of porting Caffe to a Xeon Phi, we will use the new latedays cluster for hardware. 
</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
In order to complete this project in a timely manner, we will keep the following schedule:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Week 1: Familiarize with Caffe framework codebase / Halide language basics </li>
<li> Week 2: Develop basic algorithms in Halide / rewrite parts of Caffe in C++ for framework understanding. </li>
<li> Week 3: Port necessary components to Halide. </li>
<li> Week 4: Test / compare. </li>
<li> Week 5: Extra / buffer time. </li>
</ul>

This is the project page for a 15-418 class project at Carnegie Mellon University. It will (eventually) be updated to look pretty (probably).
