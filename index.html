<h1>Title</h1>
Halide Implementation of the Caffe Deep Learning Framework - Philip Massey & Arjun Kar

<h2>Summary</h2>
Our project is to port the deep learning framework <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a> to the image processing language <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a>.
However, this is a daunting project.
In the event that this proves too difficult / impractical with the current state of the framework or language, we may opt to instead do a simplier project.
Based on which of the two resources are proving difficult, we will either port Caffe to a Xeon Phi, or develop a neural network in Halide.

<h2>Background</h2>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
This project is very challenging for a few reasons. Deep learning through neural networks is a nontrivial application of machine learning. Simply developing the methods of forward and backward propagation to train the weights of hidden layers is a challenge. Caffe is known for being one of the best implementations of neural networks and is developed for both CPUs and GPUs. Halide is a powerful API / language built on C++ used for image processing in an object-oriented method. Our main goal, porting the backend of Caffe to Halide requires us to both completely understand neural network training, hack into the open-source Caffe framework, and learn Halide. In the event that this proves impractical -- due either to difficulties with Halide or Caffe -- our backup goals are still nontrivial. Porting Caffe to a Xeon Phi requires rewriting of its backend to work with many more cores than usual, and writing a neural network in Halide requires the learning of a new language and paradigm (as well as understand how to turn neural network training into a parallel process).

<h2>Resources</h2>
For this project, we have collected the following resources (and may collect more as the project continues):

- Caffe Deep-Learning Framework (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- Halide programming language (http://halide-lang.org/)

<h2>Goals & Deliverables</h2>
By the end of this project, we hope to have a working implementation of Caffe's neural network written in Halide. We will then compare (and perhaps optimize) the performance of this algorithm with other implementations. In the event that this component of our project isn't completed and we simply port Caffe to a Xeon Phi or develop a neural network in Halide, we will compare performance via training time, testing time, and accuracy with other CPU and GPU implementations. These tests would be done on a consistent dataset, such as CIFAR-10. 

<h2>Platform Choices</h2>
We will be working in unix environment, coding our project in C++ and Halide. This is because caffe is originally in C++, and Halide is our target port language. If our project gains the objective of porting Caffe to a Xeon Phi, we will use the new latedays cluster for hardware. 

<h2>Schedule</h2>
week 1: Familiarize with Caffe framework codebase / Halide language basics
week 2: Develop basic algorithms in Halide / rewrite parts of Caffe in C++ for framework understanding.
week 3: Port necessary components to Halide.
week 4: Test / compare.
week 5: Extra / spillover time.

This is the project page for a 15-418 class project at Carnegie Mellon University. It will (eventually) be updated to look pretty (probably).
