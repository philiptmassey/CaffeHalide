<h1>Functional Neural Network Evaluation in Halide</h1>

Our submission for the 15-418 Parallelism Competition is our evaluation of using Halide, a functional programming language designed for image processing and computational photography, to construct a neural network.
Neural networks are an increasingly popular structure for machine learning, especially image recognition tasks.
Because of Halide's design, parallelizing image processing tasks is incredibly simple, and we believe that it will translate well to evaluating neural networks.
